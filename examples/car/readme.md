# Engine Context

This is the experimentation project used as a testbed for the implementation of the SDK.

## Description

This project represents a basic engine that has some descriptive details and that can be started, stopped and
throttled (changeRPM).
All references in this project are source-based. For real-world implementations, the SDK will be provided by Nuget
Packages.

## Motivation

- As **a developer in this project**
- I **require a test project that I can use as a testbed for implementing this SDK**
- So **I can verify the correctness of the SDK's implementation**
